Input variables:
  - TRAIN_NPZ: path to a .npz file containing the train set. It must contain three
    elements: an X matrix, a y vector, and a featnames vector (optional)
  - TEST_NPZ: path to a .npz file containing the test set. It must contain three
    elements: an X matrix, a y vector, and a featnames vector (optional)
  - PARAMS_JSON: path to a json file with the hyperparameters
    - None
Output files:
  - y_pred.npz: predictions on the test set.
  - scores.npz: contains the featnames, wether each feature was selected, their scores
    and the hyperparameters selected by cross-validation
  - scores.tsv: like scores.npz, but in tsv format
